# Class Activity
 
In the test repository we made last class open up the README.md and edit it. (You edit with the little pencil icon to the right) 

Working with your classmates in your breakout rooms, and referencing my slides for today, do the following three things:

1. Put your favorite quote in a block quote. Add a link to a website that provides more information about that quote. 
2. Make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in __bold__), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.
3. Lastly, make a section with some information about a terminal command you learned last week.
     + A _heading_ with the name of the command;
     + An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
     + A _list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).
     
Note that in Github you can click "Preview changes" to see what the final results are going to look like. 
     
To turn this in, copy/paste the unrendered Markdown text (with the _ and * and such, from the edit file tab) into the assignment on blackboard.

# **Creating Multiple File**
```
 touch File1 File2 File3
```
- It will create multiple files at once. 
- It is easy to create multiple empty files without having the information in it.
